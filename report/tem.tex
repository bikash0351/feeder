\chapter{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}%start arabic numbering(1,2,3..) from here
This chapter should discuss the background of the research issues being dealt with, the statement of the problem, research questions, research objectives, significance/rationale of the study, and scope and limitation of the study. The introduction must revolve around the central research issue.
\section{Background}
A brief background of the issues should be discussed in the background section. It should be done in the form of a brief literature review of related literature, which is essential to build a statement of the problem, research question, and research objectives in the later part of the INTRODUCTION chapter.
\section{Statement of the problem}
This section must indicate what the problem is, why, and how it is a problem. Similarly, the necessity to conduct the research should also be discussed. It should be supported by data or pieces of evidence. This section should be well connected with the background section and as brief as possible.
\section{Research questions}
Based on the statement of the problem research question should be formulated. Research questions should clearly state what type of answers the research is looking for.
\section{Research objectives}
This section should mention what you want to achieve from the research. Usually, the objective is presented as general objective and specific objectives. The general objective of the research should be only one and should be in line with the title. To meet the general objective, several specific objectives could be set. Specific objectives should be in line with the research questions and are more or less equal in the number of research questions.
\section{Significance/Rationale of the study}
The importance of the proposed research should be stated in this section, in terms of potential beneficiaries \& the way they will be benefited. The section should focus on justifying the topic of the proposed research.
\chapter{Literature Review}
A literature review is a survey of published materials on the topic of interest authored by accredited scholars and researchers. It is quite important to uncover what is already known in the body of knowledge before initiating any research (Hart, 1998). Hence, it is a crucial endeavor for any academic research in theoretical and conceptual progress (Shaw, 1995 and, Webster and Watson, 2002). Thus, it helps to situate your research in the context of what is already known about the topic and find the gap that your research will bridge.
\section{Related work}
\section{Related theory}
\chapter{Methodology}
This chapter includes a discussion about the way you conducted your thesis research to meet the objectives. The methodology should be summarized in the form of a block diagram /flowchart. The selected method should be discussed in detail along with the justification for selecting the methodology. Each method used in the thesis should be directly and specifically linked with the research objectives. It should include research design (historical research, experimental research, field research, and survey research), research approaches (qualitative, quantitative), study area, study population, sample selection (sample selection methods), sample size, methods of data collection (Key Informant Interview, Focused Group Discussion, questionnaire survey, modeling, observation, measurement) and data analysis approach \& tools.
\chapter{Experimental Setup (if any)}
In this section, you describe how the experiment was done and summarize how the data was taken. One typically describes the instruments and detectors that were used. Describe the procedure that was followed to collect the data etc.
\chapter{Results \& Discussion}
This section should present the findings of the study in logical sequences in line with the specific objectives. The presentation of data and facts should be explained regarding plausibility and compared with data from similar studies. The causal factors behind the findings should be discussed about other variables under consideration in the study based on Focused Group Discussion (FGD), Key Informant Interview (KII), questionnaire survey, modeling, observation, measurement, or literature reviews.
\chapter{Conclusions \& Recommendations}
The conclusion is an integration of various issues covered in the body of the thesis. The conclusion includes noting any implications resulting from the discussion and making policy recommendations and the need for further research. Hence, the conclusion should be a logical ending to what has been previously discussed. It must pull together all parts of the argument and refer the reader back to the focus you have outlined in your introduction and to the central topic. Never present any new information in this section. Thus, the conclusion and recommendation of the study must be limited within the scope of the research.
\chapter{Limitations and Future enhancement}
This chapter should contain the major limitations of the project and the further enhancement of the project/research shortly with a different but related approach. \textbf{Referencing checking here}\cite{giri2019transfer}
